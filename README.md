About Me And My Goals 
 
  As a software engineer with a decade of experience, I excel in designing, developing, and supporting diverse software systems, spanning mainly infrastructure and backend domains. My key attributes include effective collaboration, strong technical leadership, and a relentless pursuit of innovation and technical excellence.
  I have a deep passion for transitioning into the Machine Learning field. As a dedicated self-learner, I've completed multiple Udemy courses and amassed a ML portfolio on GitHub: https://github.com/iliya1984/DevML
  I also developed an XGBoost-based proof-of-concept for ETL execution time prediction as part of Intel's Innovation Day. I'm eager to apply my skills and contribute to the world of Machine Learning.
