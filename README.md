## Introduction <a name="introduction"></a>
  As a software engineer with a decade of experience, I excel in designing, developing, and supporting diverse software systems, spanning mainly infrastructure and backend domains.
  I have a deep passion for transitioning into the Machine Learning field. As a dedicated self-learner, I've completed multiple Udemy courses and amassed this portfolio. Invite you to take a look :)

## My Toolkit <a name="my_toolkit"></a>
  This repository contains multiple Jupyter notebooks written in Python.
  Mostly used libraries are Pytorch, XGboost, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Pandas and Numpy
